# Optimal-no-of-Convolution-Layers
An Analysis on the Convolutional Neural Networks: Optimal no. of Convolution Layers in a model

# Objective
Our main objective is to determine the parameters of a CNN to maximize its accuracy and efficiency. In this project, we will determine the no. of Convolutional Layers (Convolution + Pooling) required for an optimal model. A series of Convolutional models will be defined with different amount of Convolutional Layers and trained on a same dataset. The models are, then, compared based on Accuracy, Training Loss, Evaluation Loss.

# Details
In this project, we will be training a model whose motive is to classify images of Dogs and Cats accurately. For this purpose, we will be using the ‘Dogs-vs-Cats’ dataset available in Kaggle. The dataset contains 25,000 labelled training images and 12,500 unlabelled testing images. Data  augmentation is performed on the dataset for the model’s adaptability. The model is developed and trained in Python Programming Language with Keras Framework.
